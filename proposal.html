      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
          ​​Our website allows users to upload their own music for the world to see. 
          Millions of people listen to music daily, while others make music on a daily basis. 
          Our website promotes collaboration between musicians. 
          A unique feature on our website is the ability to duet other users. 
          When an artist composes a song, there are usually many other people who help with background vocals, musical instruments, and production among other things. 
          Usually, small creators aren’t well equipped with those types of equipment and skillset, making it hard for them to make quality music. With this feature, small creators can add their own music to another creator’s, making a more complete song. 
          This can look something like a listener liking the beatboxing of a creator and deciding to upload a rap to it. 
          This feature is like the application 
          <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/duets">Tik Tok’s</a> 
          ‘duet’ feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there are many websites that allow creators to upload their music to a platform, most of these websites don’t have the collaborative feature that our website promotes. 
          For 
          <a href="https://blog.soundcloud.com/2018/11/08/maximize-collaboration-private-track-playlist-sharing-ios/">SoundCloud</a>, arguably the most popular music platform, their form of collaboration includes sharing playlists. 
          On the other hand, websites that do offer a collaborative feature, like 
          <a href="https://www.wikiloops.com/backingtrack.php">wikiloops</a>, tend to be a bit outdated. 
          With our website, the listener can simply click a button to upload their own piece and collaborate with the composer.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
          The users of this app will be anyone who is interested in listening to or creating their own music and it will be an app that is accessible to any user. The kinds of information that the users will be viewing are other user’s profiles, how many listens a soundtrack has, comments, likes, etc. With our app, we hope to give people the chance to collaborate with others who are also interested in creating music. We think that a problem for many music creators is that they have a difficult time finding other creators to work with so with this app, we hope to make it easier for everyone to collaborate on music.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the users open up the app, it will ask them to create an account. From there, there will be a page with snippets of music beats created by other users. The user can then choose to simply listen to some of the music, or add on to another user’s beat. A couple of the interactive features we are planning to incorporate are surveys and buttons. With the surveys, we hope to get feedback from the users and see what they like about the app and what they think could be improved. The buttons will allow the users to navigate through the app and view other users' music.
