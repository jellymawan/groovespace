          ​​Our website allows users to upload their own music for the world to see. 
          Millions of people listen to music daily, while others make music on a daily basis. 
          Our website promotes collaboration between musicians. 
          A unique feature on our website is the ability to duet other users. 
          When an artist composes a song, there are usually many other people who help with background vocals, musical instruments, and production among other things. 
          Usually, small creators aren’t well equipped with those types of equipment and skillset, making it hard for them to make quality music. With this feature, small creators can add their own music to another creator’s, making a more complete song. 
          This can look something like a listener liking the beatboxing of a creator and deciding to upload a rap to it. 
          This feature is like the application 
          <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/duets">Tik Tok’s</a> 
          ‘duet’ feature.
        </p>

          Although there are many websites that allow creators to upload their music to a platform, most of these websites don’t have the collaborative feature that our website promotes. 
          For 
          <a href="https://blog.soundcloud.com/2018/11/08/maximize-collaboration-private-track-playlist-sharing-ios/">SoundCloud</a>, arguably the most popular music platform, their form of collaboration includes sharing playlists. 
          On the other hand, websites that do offer a collaborative feature, like 
          <a href="https://www.wikiloops.com/backingtrack.php">wikiloops</a>, tend to be a bit outdated. 
          With our website, the listener can simply click a button to upload their own piece and collaborate with the composer.
